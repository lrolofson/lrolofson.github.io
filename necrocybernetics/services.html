                        <h1>BrainUP</h1>
                        <p>With ANC BrainUP, your synaptic frameworks can be preserved indefinitely. Through innovative ids, they can become 'sound signatures of a global environment that have existed for 100,000 years".</p>
                        <h2>Powerful</h2>
                        <p>In order to preserve the brain they needed to be completely functionalised. In addition, they already have a deep brain system â€” a brain that is fully functional. In comparison to other brain systems, the brain can preserve its own function.</p>
                        <h2>Painless</h2>
                        <p>Brains were restored whilst they still lie dormant. The only way to preserve them is by returning large quantities of them to a more compact form.</p>
                        <h2>Permanent</h2>
                        <p>The brain must be preserved in the highest imaginable type of structural integrity; this means it cannot be replicated in any condition.</p>

                        <p>American Necrocybernetics is pleased to offer this cost-reduced service to customers who do not meet their ANC Galaxy payments.

Rest assured, though, that when their consciousness is spun up again they will be exactly the same as the day they were placed in stasis.</p>
