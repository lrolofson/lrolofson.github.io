                    <p>With ANC BrainUp, your synaptic frameworks can be preserved indefinitely. Through innovative ids, they can become 'sound signatures of a global environment that have existed for 100,000 years".</p>

                    <p>Powerful: In order to preserve the brain they needed to be completely functionalised. In addition, they already have a deep brain system â€” a brain that is fully functional. In comparison to other brain systems, the brain can preserve its own function.</p>
                        
                    <p>Painless: In the UK, their brains were restored whilst they still lie dormant. The only way to preserve them is by returning large quantities of them to a more compact form.</p>
                        
                    <p>Permanent: The brain must be preserved in the highest imaginable type of structural integrity; this means it cannot be replicated in any condition.</p>
