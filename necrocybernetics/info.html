                <p>With ANC BrainUp, your synaptic frameworks can be preserved indefinitely. Through innovative ids, they can become 'sound signatures of a global environment that have existed for 100,000 years".

                    In order to preserve the brain they needed to be completely functionalised. In addition, they already have a deep brain system â€” a brain that is fully functional. In comparison to other brain systems, the brain can preserve its own function.
                    
                    In the UK, their brains were restored whilst they still lie dormant. The only way to preserve them is by returning large quantities of them to a more compact form.
                    
                    To preserve them as well: The brain must be preserved in the highest imaginable type of structural integrity; this means it cannot be replicated in any condition.</p>
