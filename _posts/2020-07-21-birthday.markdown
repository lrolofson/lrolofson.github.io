I'm 26 now. I'm sure 16 year old me would be very impressed. 26 year old me is impressed with how 25 year old me set up the /about page to automatically change my age. Weird to think about, but if github lives longer than I do that page will continue to update long after I am dead. uhhhhhh anyway remember ally mcbeal? i don't, i just remember this baby:
