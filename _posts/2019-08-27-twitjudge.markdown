Announcing `twitjudge.py`, a horrible, horrible piece of code. Initially I intended to wait to
make it public until I cleaned it up a bit, but I decided to just *send it* and see what happens.

Twitjudge is a quick-and-dirty script that parses through your Twitter archive, displays your
tweets one by one, and asks if you love it. Right now it talks like Donald Trump, which I thought
was appropriate and funny when I wrote it because I was pretty punchy, but in the future I think
I'll change the prompts to emulate a more respectable Twitter user.

I'm a bleeding heart, so it's licensed under the GPLv3. I don't know why anyone would ever want
to fork it or even use it in the first place, but hey. Principles.

You can check out the source over on [my github.](https://github.com/lrolofson/twitjudge.py)
