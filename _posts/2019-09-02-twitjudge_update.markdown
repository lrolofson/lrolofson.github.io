Hello hello!

I have two pieces of news: I migrated my site from a VM on my personal computer
to [Github Pages](pages.github.com), which represents a serious reliability
upgrade. The other piece of news is that `twitjudge.py` is now 100% friendlier.
It's not based on a Twitter user, like I said it would last time, and instead
uses verbiage loosely based on Marie Kondo. I thought that that fit with the
purpose of "tidying up your twitter account" a little better. I've continued to
make the code more modular, because that'll help quite a bit when I add a GUI.
I've also created a "testing" branch in the
[git repo](https://github.com/lrolofson/twitjudge.py) so I can muck about
without bricking the master.

In the future, I intend to:
 - start assigning releases version numbers
 - make the code prettier
 - add a gui

 That's all for now.
