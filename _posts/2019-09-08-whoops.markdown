i broke some of the pages on the site and i'm not sure how but it's too late to do anything about it

The primary lesson here is don't rush things into production, always test them in the development environment. I suspect I'll end up rolling the repo back to some point before I broke it. That means if you're reading this either the site is still broken or I managed to fix it without rolling back. The secondary lesson is that I still don't understand jekyll all that well yet. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Anyway, I'm gonna go get some sleep. G'nite.
